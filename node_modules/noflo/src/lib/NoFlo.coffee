#
# NoFlo is a Flow-Based Programming environment for JavaScript. This file provides the
# main entry point to the NoFlo network.
#
# Find out more about using NoFlo from <http://noflojs.org/documentation/>
#
# ## Main APIs
#
# ### Graph interface
#
# [Graph](Graph.html) is used for instantiating FBP graph definitions.
exports.graph = require('./Graph')
exports.Graph = exports.graph.Graph

# ### Graph journal
#
# Journal is used for keeping track of graph changes
exports.journal = require('./Journal')
exports.Journal = exports.journal.Journal

# ## Network interface
#
# [Network](Network.html) is used for running NoFlo graphs.
exports.Network = require('./Network').Network

# ### Platform detection
#
# NoFlo works on both Node.js and the browser. Because some dependencies are different,
# we need a way to detect which we're on.
exports.isBrowser = require('./Platform').isBrowser

# ### Component Loader
#
# The [ComponentLoader](ComponentLoader.html) is responsible for finding and loading
# NoFlo components.
#
# Node.js version of the Component Loader finds components and graphs by traversing
# the NPM dependency tree from a given root directory on the file system.
#
# Browser version of the Component Loader finds components and graphs by traversing
# the [Component](http://component.io/) dependency tree from a given Component package
# name.
exports.ComponentLoader = require('./ComponentLoader').ComponentLoader

# ### Component baseclasses
#
# These baseclasses can be used for defining NoFlo components.
exports.Component = require('./Component').Component
exports.AsyncComponent = require('./AsyncComponent').AsyncComponent

# ### Component helpers
#
# These helpers aid in providing specific behavior in components with minimal overhead.
exports.helpers = require './Helpers'
exports.streams = require './Streams'

# ### NoFlo ports
#
# These classes are used for instantiating ports on NoFlo components.
ports = require './Ports'
exports.InPorts = ports.InPorts
exports.OutPorts = ports.OutPorts
exports.InPort = require './InPort'
exports.OutPort = require './OutPort'

# The old Port API is available for backwards compatibility
exports.Port = require('./Port').Port
exports.ArrayPort = require('./ArrayPort').ArrayPort

# ### NoFlo sockets
#
# The NoFlo [internalSocket](InternalSocket.html) is used for connecting ports of
# different components together in a network.
exports.internalSocket = require('./InternalSocket')

# ### Information Packets
#
# NoFlo Information Packets are defined as "IP" objects.
exports.IP = require './IP'

# ## Network instantiation
#
# This function handles instantiation of NoFlo networks from a Graph object. It creates
# the network, and then starts execution by sending the Initial Information Packets.
#
#     noflo.createNetwork(someGraph, function (err, network) {
#       console.log('Network is now running!');
#     });
#
# It is also possible to instantiate a Network but delay its execution by giving the
# third `delay` parameter. In this case you will have to handle connecting the graph and
# sending of IIPs manually.
#
#     noflo.createNetwork(someGraph, function (err, network) {
#       if (err) {
#         throw err;
#       }
#       network.connect(function (err) {
#         network.start();
#         console.log('Network is now running!');
#       })
#     }, true);
exports.createNetwork = (graph, callback, options) ->
  unless typeof options is 'object'
    options =
      delay: options
  unless typeof callback is 'function'
    callback = (err) ->
      throw err if err

  network = new exports.Network graph, options

  networkReady = (network) ->
    # Send IIPs
    network.start (err) ->
      return callback err if err
      callback null, network

  # Ensure components are loaded before continuing
  network.loader.listComponents (err) ->
    return callback err if err
    # Empty network, no need to connect it up
    return networkReady network if graph.nodes.length is 0

    # In case of delayed execution we don't wire it up
    if options.delay
      callback null, network
      return

    # Wire the network up and start execution
    network.connect (err) ->
      return callback err if err
      networkReady network

  network

# ### Starting a network from a file
#
# It is also possible to start a NoFlo network by giving it a path to a `.json` or `.fbp` network
# definition file.
#
#     noflo.loadFile('somefile.json', function (err, network) {
#       if (err) {
#         throw err;
#       }
#       console.log('Network is now running!');
#     });
exports.loadFile = (file, options, callback) ->
  unless callback
    callback = options
    baseDir = null

  if callback and typeof options isnt 'object'
    options =
      baseDir: options

  exports.graph.loadFile file, (err, net) ->
    return callback err if err
    net.baseDir = options.baseDir if options.baseDir
    exports.createNetwork net, callback, options

# ### Saving a network definition
#
# NoFlo graph files can be saved back into the filesystem with this method.
exports.saveFile = (graph, file, callback) ->
  exports.graph.save file, -> callback file
